#70. Climbing Stairs
You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

#Example 1:
Input: n = 2\
Output: 2\
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
   
#Example 2:
Input: n = 3\
Output: 3\
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step


#Constraints:
- 1 <= n <= 45

#Pseudocode:
1. Instantiate new array with size of input plus 1
2. Set 1st index in array to equal 1
3. Set 2nd index in array to equal 1
4. Iterate through array staring at 2 while less than or equal to input
5. Set array index at ith position to i minus 1 plus i minus 2
6. Return index with array input value
